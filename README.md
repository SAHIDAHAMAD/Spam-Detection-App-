# Spam Detection App ðŸ“§
This project is a Spam Detection App built with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Naive Bayes classifier to identify spam messages. The app classifies messages as "spam" or "not spam" by analyzing their text content.

# Features
* Text Preprocessing: Applies essential NLP preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization, to prepare text data.
* Machine Learning Model: Implements a Naive Bayes classifier trained on labeled data for efficient spam detection.
* Interactive Frontend: Built with Streamlit, providing a real-time interface for users to input text and view classification results instantly.
# Technologies Used
* Python
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK and Scikit-learn
* Streamlit for the frontend
# Naive Bayes algorithm for classification
